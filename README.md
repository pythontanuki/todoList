# My ToDo List

This is simple TodoList. It has three functionality, addEvent, removeEvent, sortEvents.

# DEMO

You can make TodoList easily, only to push certain button.

# Features

When it comes to imagine what is todoList, it's going to have two basical functionality, addEvent, removeEvent. But myProject has one additional functionality, sortEvents. When you make todoList, you may have lots of tasks to do, and you may be confused which task should be done first. Based on proper algorithm, you should do the task whose deadline is first.(It can be solved using Greedy algorithm.) If you enter the time to deadline for each task, and you can sort those. So you're not going to be confused which task you should do. I hope this project would be helpful for you.
